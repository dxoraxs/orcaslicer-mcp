Let Claude work alongside you in a real, running OrcaSlicer. It loads models, arranges the plate, tunes settings, slices, and reads the result back as numbers you can question: which feature ate the print time, what a setting actually does, whether a profile breaks your printer's physics. Every change lands in the GUI while you watch, so the slicer stays yours and you get better at it as you go.

This package is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server: it bundles no model and talks to nothing but OrcaSlicer, at an address you configure, localhost by default. The model comes from your MCP client. If that client uses a hosted one, your conversation goes there as any chat does; your models, profiles, and gcode stay on the machine running the slicer. Point the client at a local model and nothing leaves at all.

## What it can do

### Knowing what the settings mean

An offline settings reference ships with the package, carrying the authoritative label, tooltip, type, range, enum, and default for each key, so `describe_setting`, `search_settings`, and `compare_settings` answer from OrcaSlicer's own source instead of guessing. `consult` composes curated slicing knowledge and your saved notes by topic, symptom, or goal.

`check_profile_physics` is a deterministic gate. It overlays proposed changes on the live config, runs flow, temperature, geometry, and cooling math, then returns `ok`, `warnings`, or `blocked`. Accelerations your printer cannot reach and speeds past the flow ceiling get caught before they reach a print.

### Settings

Read and write any of roughly 800 OrcaSlicer settings on the live config, for the whole plate or scoped narrower: `get_config`, `set_config`, `find_config_keys`, `set_layer_height`, `set_height_range` for a band of layers, and `set_object_config` for one object's overrides.

### Presets

`list_presets`, `select_preset`, `get_preset_config`, `edit_preset`, `save_preset`, `rename_preset`, `delete_preset`.

### Slicing, and reading the result back

`slice`, `slice_and_wait`, `apply_and_slice`, `cancel_slice`, `get_slice_status`, `get_slice_warnings`, `get_gcode`.

`get_slice_breakdown` returns per-feature time, filament, and flow. OrcaSlicer shows the same information in the legend beside its preview, sized for a screen; this returns it as numbers an assistant can compare and act on:

```
role                    time      share   filament   mean flow
inner_wall              5m 41s    30.8%     6.43 g    16.0 mm3/s
outer_wall              3m 19s    18.0%     3.20 g    13.6 mm3/s
sparse_infill           3m 07s    17.0%     3.57 g    17.0 mm3/s
internal_solid_infill   2m 01s    11.0%     1.72 g    11.8 mm3/s
bridge                     52s     4.7%     0.26 g     4.4 mm3/s
support_interface          36s     3.2%     0.52 g    12.3 mm3/s
overhang_perimeter         28s     2.5%     0.13 g     3.7 mm3/s
internal_bridge            21s     1.9%     0.45 g    19.9 mm3/s
top_surface                19s     1.7%     0.29 g    12.5 mm3/s
brim                       12s     1.1%     0.21 g    14.7 mm3/s
bottom_surface              7s     0.7%     0.10 g    11.8 mm3/s
                        18m 24s            16.89 g
```

It answers which feature is eating the time without slicing repeatedly to find out. A `prediction_check` rides along and flags any role where the profile's requested speed got throttled at the flow ceiling.

`compare_slices` slices the current plate under several named variants and returns one comparison, so "what does layer height actually cost me?" is a single question rather than four manual slices. It applies each variant over your original config, restores it when done, and hands back a verdict plus a table with every delta already worked out:

```
Recommended: 0.4mm - fastest with no warnings.

variant     time      filament   vs 0.4mm (baseline)
0.3mm       8h 10m    41.0 g      +1h 30m (+22%), -7.0 g (-15%)
0.4mm  *    6h 40m    48.0 g      baseline
0.5mm       5h 20m    53.4 g      -1h 20m (-20%), +5.4 g (+11%)
0.6mm       4h 35m    57.1 g      -2h 05m (-31%), +9.1 g (+19%)  thin-wall warning
```

It only crowns a winner when one variant genuinely beats the rest on time, filament, and warnings; when they trade off, it names the fastest, the lightest, and where the warnings landed, and leaves the choice in front of you. Pass `detail=True` for the per-feature split of each variant.

### Models and the plate

`load_model` (`.stl`, `.obj`, `.3mf`, plus `.step` and `.stp` on fork v2.3.2-mcp.3 and later), `list_objects` with each object's world-space bounding box and an `on_plate` flag, `transform_object`, `duplicate_object`, `delete_object`, `arrange_plate`, `auto_orient`, `check_placement`, `diagnose_plate`, `get_job_status`.

### Plate renders

`render_plate` hands back a PNG, so the assistant can look instead of inferring from coordinates. A rotation reads instantly as a picture and barely at all as three Euler angles. Seven camera angles cover `iso`, `top`, `front`, `left`, `right`, `rear`, and `bottom`. Use `frame="plate"` to stand back for the whole bed, or `frame="object"` to lean in on the part. Requires fork v2.3.2-mcp.4 or later.

| `view="editor"` | `view="preview"` |
|---|---|
| ![A press-fit tube connector sitting on the bed](docs/images/conn-editor.png) | ![The same part sliced, toolpaths coloured by feature role](docs/images/conn-preview.png) |
| Your models on the bed. Answers orientation, plate contact, and first-layer footprint. | Sliced toolpaths coloured by feature role, so support placement is plain to see. |

`describe_plate` answers the same questions as numbers and one sentence per object, computed from the sliced G-code: how the part stands (flat, tilted, or on an edge or corner, from first-layer contact against its widest layer), the first-layer footprint as islands, where overhang extrusions concentrate by height band, where support stands and where it touches the part, and which side the seams sit on, checked against `seam_position`. It exists because an assistant reads a sentence more reliably than a picture. Copies of an object are aggregated; the islands still show each copy's contact patch. On a plate of three tilted connector copies it reads: "Body4.stl (3 copies) stands on an edge or corner: first-layer contact is 5% of its widest layer, in 3 islands of about 50 mm2 each. Overhang extrusions concentrate at Z 0 to 10 mm. Support is present from Z 0.4 to 56.8 mm, standing in 3 places and touching the part in 7 zones. Seams align on the +Y side (91%), matching seam_position=back."

### Live state and memory

`get_status` and `watch_events` report what the slicer is doing now. `remember` persists machine, user, and project facts for later sessions, as plain local files in `~/.orcaslicer-mcp/notes/`, relocatable with `ORCA_MCP_NOTES_DIR`.

### Learning from real prints

`save_gcode` saves the last successful slice's G-code and records the model, geometry, and full settings snapshot that produced it. Set `PRINT_OUTCOMES_DIR` to say exactly where; otherwise it writes into the shared print-outcomes folder (`~/projects/_shared/print-outcomes/`) if that folder already exists on this machine, and into `~/.orcaslicer-mcp/` (the same folder `remember` uses) if it does not. `recall_prints` reads the shared folder before you slice, so the assistant can say how past prints of this model actually went: success, cancelled, or the verdict you gave it, and the settings used.

Recording and recall both depend on a companion service, the [klipper-mcp](https://github.com/MaxEllis/klipper-mcp) server, whose `klipper-mcp-capture` process writes the real print result into the same store once your printer finishes the job, and whose `start_print` tool uploads the file `save_gcode` saved under the same filename. Without that companion, `save_gcode` still writes the G-code file (its folder is created on first use even so) but records nothing, and `recall_prints` returns `available: false` and does nothing else. Neither tool makes the server contact you on its own; the assistant only sees new outcomes when it calls `recall_prints` again in a later session.

## What you need

Stock OrcaSlicer ships without a control API, so a matching build does that half of the job.

1. **The OrcaSlicer MCP build.** OrcaSlicer 2.3.2 with an embedded local API, token-authenticated and bound to localhost until you say otherwise. Get it from the [releases page](https://github.com/MaxEllis/OrcaSlicer/releases). If no binary is up for your platform yet, build the `remote-api` branch from source.
2. **This package (`orcaslicer-mcp`).** The MCP server that connects your AI client to that build.

> **Updating:** take new builds from the [releases page](https://github.com/MaxEllis/OrcaSlicer/releases), never from inside the app. The in-app updater offers *stock* OrcaSlicer, which drops the control API. Builds mcp.2 and later turn that updater off for you. On an older build, click **Skip this Version** if a "new version available" prompt appears.

## Quickstart

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first, because it provides the `uvx` command that runs the server. One line does it: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` on macOS and Linux, or `irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex` in PowerShell on Windows.

1. Install the OrcaSlicer MCP build, launch it, and finish the one-time setup by picking your printer. A fresh install may show a **“Bambu Network Plug-in Required”** dialog. Click **Skip for Now**, since that plug-in only serves Bambu cloud printing. The control API starts once setup is finished.
2. Open **Preferences** (Ctrl+P), go to **Remote API**, and tick **Enable Remote API**. Copy the token shown on that page. Access stays localhost-only unless you also switch on "Allow LAN access".
3. Connect your MCP client.

    **Claude Desktop:** download `orcaslicer-mcp-<version>.mcpb` from the [releases page](https://github.com/MaxEllis/orcaslicer-mcp/releases/latest) and open the file. Claude Desktop offers to install it. Open the extension's settings afterwards, paste the token from step 2, and enable it.

    > Ignore any guide that tells you to hand-edit `claude_desktop_config.json`. Current Claude Desktop builds rewrite that file themselves and drop added `mcpServers` entries, so the edit will not stick. The extension leaves the file alone and finds `uvx` by itself.

    **Claude Code and other MCP clients:** add the server to your client's MCP config. For Claude Code that means a project `.mcp.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "orcaslicer": {
          "command": "uvx",
          "args": ["orcaslicer-mcp"],
          "env": {
            "ORCA_API_TOKEN": "<token from Preferences>"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    `ORCA_API_URL` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:13130`. Set it only if you changed the port, or if OrcaSlicer runs on another machine with LAN access enabled there.

    > **Windows note:** if `uvx orcaslicer-mcp` fails with *"The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process"* while installing `pywin32`, Windows Search or Defender grabbed a freshly written file mid-install (uv does not retry). Use a pip-based fallback, which does retry, and point `"command"` at the resulting exe:
    >
    > ```powershell
    > python -m venv "$env:USERPROFILE\.venvs\orcaslicer-mcp"
    > & "$env:USERPROFILE\.venvs\orcaslicer-mcp\Scripts\python" -m pip install orcaslicer-mcp
    > ```
    >
    > Then set `"command"` to `C:\Users\<you>\.venvs\orcaslicer-mcp\Scripts\orcaslicer-mcp.exe` with no `args`. Upgrade later with the same pip command plus `-U`.

    > **macOS note for GUI clients other than Claude Desktop:** apps launched from the Dock do not inherit your terminal's PATH, so `"command": "uvx"` can fail silently. Run `which uvx` in Terminal, then paste the full path it prints into `"command"`. It is usually `~/.local/bin/uvx`.

4. Restart your client and ask: *"Load benchy.stl, slice it with the current profile, and tell me the print time."*

## Security

- The control API binds **127.0.0.1 only** by default. LAN access is an explicit opt-in in Preferences.
- Every request must carry the API token. OrcaSlicer generates it on first run and can regenerate it at any time.
- The MCP server runs as a local stdio process and opens no connection except to OrcaSlicer. No telemetry.
- The MCP server refuses to change config keys that run code or drive the printer directly. They are `post_process`, every `*_gcode` template, `printer_model`, `printer_technology`, `filename_format`, and the printer connection settings (`print_host`, `printhost_*`, `host_type`, `printer_agent` and the rest of OrcaSlicer's physical-printer keys). The list lives in `src/orcaslicer_mcp/guard.py`. An assistant holding the API token can be steered by text it reads, such as model names, G-code or web pages. Since `post_process` runs shell commands after export, these stay a human decision in the OrcaSlicer GUI.
- Writing a key back to the value it already has is allowed, so restores keep working. The host address and its credentials are the exception. OrcaSlicer never reports their current value, so any write to them is refused. `edit_preset` runs the check before it selects the preset, which means a refused edit leaves your unsaved changes alone.
- To let the MCP write specific keys anyway, list them in `ORCA_MCP_ALLOW_KEYS`, comma separated. Wildcards work, for example `*_gcode`. The Claude Desktop extension exposes it as a setting. At startup the server logs any name that matches no protected key, which is usually a typo.
- This check covers the MCP server's own tools only. An assistant that can also run shell commands could read the token and call OrcaSlicer directly. OrcaSlicer MCP v2.4.2-mcp.10 and later apply the same rule inside the slicer, and it stays on until you tick **Allow script, G-code and connection edits** in Preferences → Remote API. On those builds the assistant needs both: that box ticked and the keys listed in `ORCA_MCP_ALLOW_KEYS`.
- `get_preset_config` hides `printhost_apikey`, `printhost_user` and `printhost_password`. It also removes any `user:password@` from `print_host` and `print_host_webui` before the model sees them. A value carrying the `<redacted>` placeholder is never written back.

## Development

```bash
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
uv run pytest   # unit tests against a mock API, plus a guarded live smoke test
```

The live smoke test skips itself unless `ORCA_API_URL` and `ORCA_API_TOKEN` point at a running OrcaSlicer MCP build.

Protocol notes, design specs, and verification results live in [`docs/`](docs/).

## Privacy policy

The server talks to OrcaSlicer's local API at the address you configure, localhost by default, and to nothing else. It has no backend, so there is no service of ours for anything to reach. What leaves your machine is whatever your MCP client sends its model: the conversation, plus any settings or file contents you or the assistant put into it. Their terms govern that traffic, and it is the same traffic any other use of that client produces. A local model removes it entirely.

- **Data collection:** none. The server collects nothing about you or your usage.
- **Usage and storage:** models, settings, and gcode stay on the computer running OrcaSlicer, held in memory only for the duration of each request. The API token authenticates the server to OrcaSlicer, and your MCP client stores it. Claude Desktop keeps extension settings in the operating system's credential store.
- **Third-party sharing:** none by this server, which has no analytics and no backend. Traffic between your client and its model provider sits outside this project and falls under their policies.
- **Data retention:** the only data written to disk is notes you save yourself with `remember`, stored as plain files under `~/.orcaslicer-mcp/notes/`, and the G-code plus slice records that `save_gcode` writes: under `~/projects/_shared/print-outcomes/` when that shared folder already exists, otherwise under `~/.orcaslicer-mcp/` (either relocatable with `PRINT_OUTCOMES_DIR`), read back by `recall_prints` and joined with real print results by the separate klipper-mcp project. Read or delete either folder whenever you like. Delete them and nothing remains.
- **Contact:** questions and concerns go in [an issue](https://github.com/MaxEllis/orcaslicer-mcp/issues).

## Status

Early public release, soft launch. The server carries 183 unit tests and gets exercised on real print jobs. Prebuilt OrcaSlicer MCP builds cover Windows, macOS, and Linux on the [releases page](https://github.com/MaxEllis/OrcaSlicer/releases). Issues and reports are welcome.

## Support

The project is free and stays that way. If it saves you time and you feel like saying thanks, you can buy me a coffee.
